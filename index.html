						Welcome to your graveyard! Your goal is to make it the scariest as possible. The scary-o-meter <span class="tile scaryometer"></span>,

						It's because your graveyard is not very spooky for now. These white flowers <span class="tile flower"></span> are too pretty, so let's try to

						Good! You can increase the scary-o-meter of your graveyard by removing flowers, even if they regrow over time.
						Note that blue ones are soulflower <span class="tile soulflower"></span>. They generate soulstones, so you may want to keep or buy them...
						Let's try to plant <b>5</b> soulflowers.

				<aside class="tuto step4">
					<p>
						Well done! But with all these flowers, your graveyard is definitively not scary... Let's try to add <b>3</b>
						dead trees <span class="tile tree"></span> to make it gloomier!
					</p>

				<aside class="tuto step5">
					<p>
						It's so better like that! The scary-o-meter is still negative, so you must continue!<br />You can now build tomb stones

						Very well done! Do you know that tombstones and graves can be upgraded? Keep an eye on them: if they're glowing <span class="tile tombstone upgradable"></span>, they can upgrade!

						Did you see how he ran away? You earn some soulstones every time someone is scared to death like that. Some humans are braver than others,
